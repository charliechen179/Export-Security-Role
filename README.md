# Dynamics CRM Chat
Most of the time in Dynamics 365 we needs some functionality to add Chat.
We want to communicate with Dynamics CRM. There are some third party which allow user chat from Portal to dynamics CRM or Dynamics unified service
Unfortunately Dynamics not give and built-in capability for this.
But Dynamics 365 developer can build their own customization to achieve this.

I am sharing the solution with help of these can integrate Internal Chat in your Dynamics 365.
You can send your instance message to other users. They can see message on single.
I have added a global button in Site map bar. So user can use this feature anytime.
